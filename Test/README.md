# BlackJack Game

A Blakc Jack game built with Unity as a fun challenge.
This was a challenge project I was assigned to show some coding skills and ability to self-learn new concepts. 
The main challenges while building this game was understanding how to use Unity, basically every aspect of it was fairly difficult
from researching how to generate a 2-D plane to how to get assets to make cards. On the logic side of things C# seems to be very similar to Java so there was knowledge transfer there atleast. Once packaged the game ran just fine which was a relief but struggles to work at different scaling(aspect ratios) which I am not too sure on how to fix. 

## Getting Started
